# Life Flow Simulation

## Description
Life Flow Simulation is an interactive web application based on the classic "Game of Life" cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This project provides a platform to observe the evolution of a grid-based cell system following a set of simple rules.

## Features
- Interactive grid to set initial cell states.
- Start, Stop, and Reset controls for the simulation.
- Step-by-step simulation control.
- Random state generator for quick setup.
- Display of live and dead cell statistics.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java
- Framework: Spring Boot
